// Create a program to check if a given number is prime.

// I can help you create a JavaScript program to check if a given number is prime. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Here's a simple program using a function to determine whether a number is prime or not...

function isPrime(number) {
  
}

// Test the function
const testNumber = 13;
if (isPrime(testNumber)) {
  console.log(`${testNumber} is a prime number`);
} else {
  console.log(`${testNumber} is not a prime number`);
}
