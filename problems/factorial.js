// Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
// Factorial is a mathematical operation often used in programming and mathematics. It's denoted by an exclamation mark (!) and applied to a non-negative integer n. The factorial of n, represented as ! n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

// In programming, calculating factorials is often done using loops or recursive functions. Here's an example of a factorial function in JavaScript using recursion.

function factorial(number) {
  
}

console.log(factorial(5));
console.log(factorial(4));
